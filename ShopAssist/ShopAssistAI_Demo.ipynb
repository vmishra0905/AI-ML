In particular, you worked with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 models along with their ‘Completion’ and ‘ChatCompletion’ APIs to build a simple AI tutor.\n","\n","Next, you went over some principles, techniques, and tactics for prompt engineering.\n","The two main principles of writing a good prompt - (i) Providing clear instructions, (ii) Enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.\n","\n","Under providing clear instructions, you learnt how to structure the body of a prompt through 5 components - Task, Role, Context, Guidelines and Output Format. You also understood that providing a very clear syntax and conditioning on good performance can get you closer to the desired output.\n","\n","Next, under enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, you learnt two specific techniques - (i) Chain-of-Thought prompting, (ii) Few-Shot prompting. Under chain-of-thought prompting, you essentially enable the LLM to work through the solution step-by-step and in few-shot prompting, you provide relevant examples of how you want the outputs to look like. So now you could structure your prompts into proper components and provide clear chain-of-thought instructions along with relevant examples of ideal inputs and outputs.\n","\n","You also learnt some advanced prompting techniques like self-consistency and ReAct prompting. Self-consistency is basically the technique where you ensemble multiple attempts and select the most consistent output out of them. And in ReAct prompting, you enable the LLM to reason out a scenario and act based on some examples.\n","\n","Finally, you looked at some examples of how you can design LLM-based systems. Apart from prompting techniques, you understood that designing a LLM-based system also requires a safe design, i.e., the capabilities to detect and respond to unsafe user queries and prompt injections. You looked at the moderation API offered by OpenAI that can help you design such safer systems.\n","\n","With all of these learnings, let’s now get started on designing our first LLM application - ShopAssist AI.\n","\n","\n","#### Project Background\n","\n","In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. To address this, we have developed **ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery**.\n","\n","\n","#### Problem Statement\n","\n","*Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements*.\n","\n","\n","You can load the data and see it here.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"_5VGNUMENvmg","metadata":{"id":"_5VGNUMENvmg"},"source":["**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Make sure that OpenAI version 0.28 is installed first prior to running the notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"l7BLDeM5MXrC","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3340,"status":"ok","timestamp":1754676382702,"user":{"displayName":"Vijay Mishra","userId":"04991935121956538714"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"l7BLDeM5MXrC","outputId":"19b975db-efe2-45cf-c094-46a63d7e6097"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import openai\n","import os\n","key_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GENAI/'\n","with open(key_path + 'OpenAI_API_Key.txt', 'r') as f:\n","  openai.api_key = ' '.join(f.readlines())\n","\n","# Update the OpenAI API key by updating the environment variable\n","os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = openai.api_key"],"metadata":{"id":"5G2ZwU9XJSw7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754676004161,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3266,"user":{"displayName":"Vijay Mishra","userId":"04991935121956538714"}}},"id":"5G2ZwU9XJSw7","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"79IX-HkXJXhJ"},"id":"79IX-HkXJXhJ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"29adca8b","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":573},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":957,"status":"ok","timestamp":1754676009616,"user":{"displayName":"Vijay Mishra","userId":"04991935121956538714"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"29adca8b","outputId":"c7f0b93c-ef67-401c-e78f-ad3b921b668c"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["    Brand   Model Name Core CPU Manufacturer Clock Speed RAM Size  \\\n","0    Dell     Inspiron   i5            Intel     2.4 GHz      8GB   \n","1     MSI         GL65   i7            Intel     2.6 GHz     16GB   \n","2      HP    EliteBook   i7            Intel     2.8 GHz     16GB   \n","3  Lenovo      IdeaPad   i3            Intel     2.1 GHz      8GB   \n","4    ASUS  ZenBook Pro   i9            Intel     3.1 GHz     64GB   \n","\n","  Storage Type Display Type Display Size Graphics Processor Screen Resolution  \\\n","0          SSD          LCD        15.6\"          Intel UHD         1920x1080   \n","1      HDD+SSD          IPS        15.6\"         NVIDIA GTX         1920x1080   \n","2          SSD          LED          14\"          Intel UHD         1920x1080   \n","3          HDD           TN        15.6\"          Intel UHD          1366x768   \n","4          SSD         OLED        15.6\"         NVIDIA RTX         3840x2160   \n","\n","           OS Laptop Weight    Special Features Warranty Average Battery Life  \\\n","0  Windows 10        2.5 kg    Backlit Keyboard   1 year              6 hours   \n","1  Windows 10        2.3 kg        RGB Keyboard  2 years              4 hours   \n","2  Windows 11        1.5 kg  Fingerprint Sensor  3 years              8 hours   \n","3  Windows 10        2.2 kg         Dolby Audio   1 year              5 hours   \n","4  Windows 10        1.8 kg    NanoEdge Display  2 years              7 hours   \n","\n","     Price                                        Description  \n","0   35,000  The Dell Inspiron is a versatile laptop that c...  \n","1   55,000  The MSI GL65 is a high-performance laptop desi...  \n","2   90,000  The HP EliteBook is a premium laptop designed ...  \n","3   25,000  The Lenovo IdeaPad is a versatile laptop that ...  \n","4  200,000  The ASUS ZenBook Pro is a high-end laptop that...
